# Publix-Salesmap
With all that being said, I will like to present my Grocery Department Cheat Sheet (the name is still TBD ?). 

These are the tools that I used: 

• ?Python & Selenium Webdriver: Used a process called Web Scraping on the weekly ad portion of the Publix website to give me just the names of the sale items (See pic (B)). All of these names are stored on a excel file made by the web scraper. 

• ?Python (Turtle module): Created a map of the grocery department’s aisles. This map includes numbers that correspond to end caps and “2Ds” as well call it. Essentially, any secondary location a sale item may be at could be referenced with this map and noted on the printed sales items list. (See pic (C))

• ?HTML, and CSS: Nicely displays the sale items on a private website that can be printed. (See pic (A))

I am very pleased with how my project is coming along so far. My Grocery managers and fellow employees have found the list very resourceful and it has definitely helped me improve my performance as a Stock Clerk at Publix. There will be more to come— like automating secondary sale locations and expanding aisle maps.
